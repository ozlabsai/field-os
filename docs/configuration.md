# Deployment configuration

Environment variables for a FieldOS deployment, and which are safe to leave unset.

Two rules explain most of the layout:

- **Authentication and authorization settings are env-driven, never admin-editable.** They must not
  be weakenable from a compromised admin session. Everything "soft" — branding, agent instructions,
  which connectors are offered — lives in `AdminConfig` and is edited from the admin panel instead.
- **Session bounds are the one bridge between the two.** The env vars set a *ceiling*; an admin may
  tighten below it and can never exceed it.

## Identity and access

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ADMINS` | none | Array of usernames with admin rights. An admin with no entry here has none. |
| `AUTH_GATEKEEPERS` | unset | Comma-separated vendor ids offered as sign-in buttons, e.g. `oidc`. Only vendors advertising `providesAuth` are eligible. Unset means password login only. |
| `DISABLE_PASSWORD_AUTH` | `false` | `"true"` hides username/password login. Ignored unless at least one auth gatekeeper is allowlisted, so a deployment cannot lock everyone out. |

### Frontend asset variant — a build-time choice, not a setting

`VITE_CF_ACCESS_MODE` is compiled into the frontend bundle, so it **cannot be changed at deploy
time**. Every release therefore ships two asset variants and a deployment selects one:

| Variant | For | |
|---|---|---|
| `password` | **Self-hosted and airgapped deployments** | Renders the password login and `/signup`. |
| `access` | Deployments behind Cloudflare Access | Delegates auth to Access; no login page of its own. |

**An airgapped deployment must use `password`.** With the `access` variant and no Cloudflare in
front, the app calls `authenticateFromCfAccess()`, which throws because `CF_ACCESS_AUD` is unset —
so the page renders "Authenticating…" forever and `/signup` redirects away, leaving no way to
create a first user. It looks like a hang rather than a misconfiguration, which is what makes it
worth stating plainly.

The variants are content-addressed and share whatever bytes are identical, so carrying both costs
far less than double.

### Single sign-on (`gatekeeper-oidc`)

Set on the connector, not the backend. See
[`packages/gatekeeper-oidc/README.md`](../packages/gatekeeper-oidc/README.md).

| Variable | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `OIDC_ISSUER` | yes | Issuer base URL, no trailing slash. Endpoints come from its discovery document. |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_ID` | yes | Confidential client registered for this deployment. |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` | yes | That client's secret. |
| `OIDC_SCOPES` | no | Extra scopes; `openid` and `email` are always requested. |
| `OIDC_GROUPS_CLAIM` | no | Claim to read group membership from, for org separation. There is no standard name, so this is configuration rather than a constant. Unset means this deployment does not use org separation at all. |
| `OIDC_ORG_PREFIX` | no | Optional prefix marking which groups are orgs, e.g. with `fieldos-` set, the group `fieldos-legal` yields org `legal`. Users are typically in many groups unrelated to FieldOS, so most deployments that set `OIDC_GROUPS_CLAIM` will want this too. |

Add `oidc` to `AUTH_GATEKEEPERS` to surface the button. The provider must issue a **verified**
email — sign-in is refused when `email_verified` is not `true`, because accounts are keyed by email.

#### Org resolution

Org separation is off unless `OIDC_GROUPS_CLAIM` is set. When it is set, a missing or ambiguous
claim resolves to **no org, never a default org** — a user is either placed in exactly one org or
placed in none; there is no fallback org that soaks up the unresolved cases. Concretely:

- If the claim is absent, empty, or not a string/array, the user has no org.
- If more than one group matches (after applying `OIDC_ORG_PREFIX`), the user has no org. Picking
  one of several matches would make access depend on the IdP's serialization order for the claim,
  which is not something to build authorization on.

**Microsoft Entra: this is a hard requirement, not a tip.** Above 200 groups (JWT tokens) or 150
groups (SAML), Entra omits the groups claim entirely and substitutes a pointer to Microsoft Graph
for the full list — which an airgapped deployment cannot reach. A user in 250 groups then looks
identical to a user in zero groups: no claim, no org. **Entra deployments must be configured to
emit only the groups assigned to the application** (via the app registration's group claims
configuration), not the user's full group membership, or affected users will silently lose org
access.

Keycloak emits group membership as **paths**, not names: its group-membership mapper defaults
`full.path` to true, so a top-level group arrives as `/fieldos-legal` and a nested one as
`/eng/fieldos-legal`. The connector matches on the **last path segment**, so `OIDC_ORG_PREFIX` never
needs to account for the slash or for where a group sits in the hierarchy. One consequence worth
knowing: the org is the leaf name, so `/eng/legal` and `/legal` are the same org.

Where the groups claim comes from, per provider:

- **Keycloak**: not included by default — add a "Group Membership" mapper to the client's client
  scope. Check the mapper's **ID token** checkbox: mappers have independent per-token settings, and
  one that populates only userinfo or the access token leaves this connector seeing no claim (it
  reads the ID token and never calls userinfo).
- **Okta**: not included by default, and it needs **two** things — add a Groups claim to the
  authorization server (filtered to the groups this application should see), *and* add `groups` to
  `OIDC_SCOPES`, since Okta gates the claim on the scope being requested. Okta emits group **names**
  as an array of strings. On the org authorization server the claim can only go in the ID token; a
  custom authorization server can put it in either.
- **Authentik**: group names are available via a scope mapping that includes `groups` in the token.
- **Entra**: **`OIDC_ORG_PREFIX` cannot work against a default Entra configuration.** By default the
  `groups` claim carries group **object IDs (GUIDs)**, not names, so no prefix will ever match and
  every user resolves to no org. The name formats (`sAMAccountName`, `NetbiosDomain\sAMAccountName`)
  exist **only on groups synced from on-prem Active Directory** — a cloud-only tenant cannot emit a
  group name in that claim at all. For Entra, prefer **App Roles**: point `OIDC_GROUPS_CLAIM` at
  `roles` and give each role a value you control (e.g. `fieldos-legal`). App Roles are also exempt
  from the overage limit below. Also emit only application-assigned groups — see the hard
  requirement above.

**Overage is detected, not silently ignored.** When Entra substitutes `_claim_names`/`_claim_sources`
for the claim, the connector logs `oidc.org.claim.overage` at error level and the user resolves to
no org. Sign-in still succeeds: org resolution runs during ID-token verification, so refusing the
login would turn a claim misconfiguration into an outage. Search the logs for that event before
concluding that a user's missing access is a permissions bug.

### Cloudflare Access

Only relevant when running behind Cloudflare Access. An airgapped deployment leaves both unset and
uses password login or OIDC.

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `CF_ACCESS_AUD` | Application audience tag. Setting it enables Access authentication. |
| `CF_ACCESS_ISS` | Team domain; its JWKS verifies the assertion. |

Note this path carries **no session record** — authority is the per-request JWT, and its lifetime
belongs to the identity provider, so the session bounds below do not apply to it.

## Sessions

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `SESSION_MAX_LIFETIME_HOURS` | `12` | Ceiling on absolute session lifetime, from sign-in. Never extended by activity. |
| `SESSION_MAX_IDLE_MINUTES` | `60` | Ceiling on the idle window, refreshed by user-driven activity. |

Both are **ceilings**. An admin may configure shorter values; anything longer is clamped, and
lowering a ceiling tightens existing deployments immediately without rewriting stored config. A
non-positive or unparseable value falls back to the default — `0` never means "no expiry".

Defaults suit a classified-network deployment, where accreditation regimes generally expect idle
timeouts in the tens of minutes and re-authentication at least daily. Raise them for a
lower-sensitivity deployment; the ceiling exists so the decision is an operator's, not an admin's.

Where an external IdP issues the session, its expiry wins when shorter, but is still clamped to
these ceilings — a permissive IdP cannot mint an effectively immortal session.

## Org separation

Multiple organizations sharing one deployment. A workspace is stamped with its creator's org at
creation; with enforcement on, a **non-owner** may only open a workspace stamped with their own
org. Owners always reach their own workspaces, whatever the org state — which is what keeps a
misconfiguration recoverable rather than a lockout.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ENABLE_ORG_SEPARATION` | `false` | `"true"` enforces the boundary. Everything below is inert while this is off. |
| `ALLOW_CROSS_ORG_SHARING` | `false` | `"true"` permits a collaborator from another org. Only consulted when the above is on. |

**These are env vars, not admin settings, deliberately.** Like the sign-in configuration above,
they gate authorization, so they must not be changeable from a compromised admin session — see the
header of `admin-config.ts`. Changing them takes a deploy.

**Read this before turning it on.** Enforcement is reversible by design, but two things are worth
knowing first:

- A workspace whose org stamp *failed* at creation (an IdP or user-DO hiccup) is denied to
  non-owners, not treated as exempt — otherwise anything that induced that failure would mint a
  permanently boundary-exempt workspace. Workspaces created before org separation existed carry no
  stamp at all and stay reachable; the two cases are distinguished deliberately.
- Verify the resolved org for real users **before** enabling. The admin read-out exists for exactly
  that, and a boundary that denies the wrong people is far more disruptive than one not yet on.

Turning the flag back off restores access with nothing lost — an org denial deliberately does not
drop the collaborator's workspace listing, unlike a genuine loss of access.

### Finding and fixing a workspace that was stamped during an outage

Stamping is best-effort at creation, because failing there would turn a brief user-DO hiccup into a
failed workspace. So an IdP outage can leave workspaces flagged as *stamp failed*, which then deny
every non-owner once enforcement is on. The owner keeps working throughout — which is what makes
this recoverable, and also why nobody notices until a collaborator complains.

**The log is the list.** Every denial emits `workspace.org.access.denied`, at `error` when the
stamp failed and `info` when the boundary is simply doing its job. There is no deployment-wide
"show me every affected workspace": Durable Objects are not enumerable and this deployment
deliberately has no user directory, so the log is the only way to learn which owners to repair.
Watch for that event at `error` level after enabling.

**The repair** is `restampUnknownOrgs(username)` on the admin API, which re-reads that owner's
current org and re-stamps the workspaces whose stamp failed. It is paged — call it again with the
returned `cursor` until `done` — and it only ever touches failed stamps. Workspaces that
legitimately predate org separation carry no stamp at all and are left alone; pulling those inside
the boundary stays an explicit decision rather than a side effect of a sweep.

## Usage limits

Two independent modes. `ENABLE_CLOUDFLARE_LIMITS` is the upstream billing flow and is irrelevant
off-platform; `ENABLE_USAGE_QUOTAS` is the airgapped equivalent with no money involved.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ENABLE_USAGE_QUOTAS` | `false` | `"true"` enforces a per-user daily call cap with no billing: no balance lookup, no BYOK, no top-up UI. Ignored when `ENABLE_CLOUDFLARE_LIMITS` is on. |
| `DAILY_LLM_CALL_LIMIT` | `100` | Calls per user per UTC day. |
| `ENABLE_CLOUDFLARE_LIMITS` | `false` | Upstream free-tier + Cloudflare AI Gateway top-up flow. Leave unset off-platform. |
| `MINIMUM_CLOUDFLARE_BALANCE` | — | Only meaningful with the above. |

Typical airgapped setting: `ENABLE_USAGE_QUOTAS=true`, `DAILY_LLM_CALL_LIMIT=250`, leaving
`ENABLE_CLOUDFLARE_LIMITS` unset.

The limit is currently one global number. Per-user or per-role limits would be an `AdminConfig`
change.

## Model inference

Not env-driven: models are configured per user or per deployment as records carrying a provider and
an optional `apiUrl`.

For a self-hosted endpoint pick the provider labelled **Local / OpenAI-compatible** and set the
base URL, e.g. `http://vllm.internal:8000/v1`. It works with any server implementing
`/v1/chat/completions` — vLLM, TGI, llama.cpp, LM Studio, Ollama — and sends no `Authorization`
header when no key is set, since a strict local proxy may reject an unexpected bearer token. (The
stored provider id is still `ollama` for backwards compatibility with existing configs.)

**Do not use the `openai` provider for a self-hosted server.** It accepts an `apiUrl`, but speaks
the newer `/v1/responses` API, which most self-hosted servers either lack or implement partially.

Two things that are *not* automatic:

- **Tool calling must be enabled on the server.** vLLM needs `--enable-auto-tool-choice` and a
  `--tool-call-parser` matching the model; llama.cpp needs `--jinja`. Without them the agent loop
  degrades silently — tool syntax comes back as ordinary text rather than a tool call.
- **Reaching a private address requires a workerd config change**, not a code change. Standalone
  workerd blocks private IPs by default (`connect() blocked by restrictPeers()`); the capnp
  `network` service needs `allow = ["public", "private"]`, and ideally specific CIDRs or an
  `ExternalServer` binding for the inference host rather than the whole RFC1918 range.

Context windows are not discoverable over the OpenAI API: an unknown model falls back to a 128k
assumption, so a server started with a smaller `--max-model-len` will receive over-sized requests.

`CF_AI_GATEWAY*` routes inference through Cloudflare AI Gateway and is opt-in; leave unset. When
unset, providers are reached directly and the gateway code path is skipped entirely.

## Storage and platform bindings

| Binding | Purpose | Self-hosted substitute |
|---|---|---|
| `BLUEPRINTS`, `AVATARS`, `CONTEXT_COLLECTIONS` | KV: blueprint metadata, avatar images, context collections | `packages/fieldos-runtime` — workerd ships the binding's client half only |
| `BLUEPRINT_CONTENT` | R2: blueprint archives and screenshots | `packages/fieldos-runtime`. **Not MinIO** — see below |
| `LOADER` | Worker Loader: **the gadget sandbox** | Native to workerd; requires the `--experimental` CLI flag |
| `ASSETS` (on `router`) | The frontend single-page app | `packages/fieldos-runtime` wrapping a capnp `disk` service; workerd has no `assets` binding type |
| `BROWSER` | Browser Rendering, for gadget PDF export | Optional — both call sites degrade with a clear error. Self-hosted Chrome later |
| `WORKERS_AI` | Document→Markdown for the `webFetch` tool only — **not** inference | Optional; fails soft to plain text. `webFetch` is near-moot on an isolated network |
| `PRODUCT_ANALYTICS` | Optional analytics pipeline | No-ops when unbound |
| `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | The deployment's public origin | — |

**KV and R2 need a server, not a store.** `kvNamespace` and `r2Bucket` are `ServiceDesignator`s in
workerd's schema: the runtime converts binding calls into HTTP requests aimed at a service you
provide, and provides none itself. So "any KV store will do" is not quite right — the store has to
speak workerd's binding protocol. `packages/fieldos-runtime` implements it.

**MinIO cannot back `BLUEPRINT_CONTENT`.** An earlier version of this table said "R2's API is
S3-compatible". That is true of R2's *S3 endpoint* and false of the *binding* this code uses, which
speaks a private protocol. Pointing the binding at MinIO does not work, and the S3-backed R2 that
Miniflare ships inverts the dependency — it would mean running MinIO as a second server process
inside the airgapped deployment.

**`WORKERS_AI` is not inference and not HTML-only.** It is `toMarkdown()`, which also converts PDF,
DOCX, XLSX and ODT. It fails soft: unsupported types return null and the caller falls back to plain
text. It is a `wrapped` binding over a module compiled into workerd whose only inner binding is a
fetcher, so a local converter can serve it later with no application change.

## Observability

| Binding | Behaviour when unbound |
|---|---|
| `FRONTEND_ERROR_REPORTER` | The `/api/client-errors` endpoint becomes a no-op |
| `FRONTEND_ERROR_RATE_LIMITER` | Same; both must be bound for reporting to dispatch |
| `ERROR_REPORTER` | `reportIssue()` no-ops. Not declared in any checked-in config |

Logging goes through `@gadgets/backend-utils/logger`, which emits one structured object per call
with a stable `component` and `event` — already the right shape for indexing, though nothing
consumes it yet. Under standalone workerd it lands on stdout, so a log shipper is the collection
path. There is no OTLP exporter; traces are Cloudflare-specific and unavailable off-platform.

*(An earlier version of this section said "all logging is plain `console.*`". That predated the
structured logger; only a handful of raw `console.` calls remain in the backend.)*

## Gadget runaway: a known availability ceiling

**A gadget stuck in an infinite loop interrupts the whole deployment until it is restarted.** State
is not lost — it is on disk — but every workspace in that process stops answering for the seconds
the restart takes.

This is not a bug we can close in the runtime. CPU, wall-clock and memory limits for Workers are
enforced by Cloudflare's *platform*, not by workerd; the open-source binary has no equivalent and
upstream is not planning one. The wedge also crosses service and socket boundaries, because workerd
serves everything on one event loop thread — so an OS process is the only boundary available.

**Isolation is unaffected.** A runaway gadget still cannot reach anything it should not: the
sandbox's `globalOutbound: null`, observation logging and approval gating all hold. It can only
refuse to stop.

`scripts/run-workerd.mjs` supervises workerd for this reason:

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--watchdog-interval` | `5000` | Milliseconds between health probes |
| `--watchdog-failures` | `3` | Consecutive failures before the process is killed and respawned |
| `--no-watchdog` | off | Disable supervision — use when attaching a debugger, or the watchdog will kill the process you are inspecting |

The probe is an external HTTP request, because nothing inside a blocked process can report its own
health. A wedged workerd also ignores `SIGTERM`, so the supervisor sends `SIGKILL` directly.

**The defaults are calibration knobs, not constants.** The watchdog cannot tell "wedged" from
"legitimately busy" — it only sees that the socket did not answer in time. Raise them for a
deployment doing heavy synchronous work; lower them to shorten the outage.

After repeated restarts in a short window the supervisor stops and exits non-zero rather than
looping: a gadget that wedges on load would otherwise restart forever. That state needs an operator.

## Known gaps

- **No admin UI for session bounds yet.** The `AdminConfig` fields exist and resolve correctly; the
  dashboard controls arrive with the wider admin panel work. Env vars work today.
- **Admin revocation targets a named user.** There is no user directory — user objects are
  addressed by name — so "revoke every session globally" is not implementable without building one.
  Worth stating to an accreditation reviewer as a scope boundary.
